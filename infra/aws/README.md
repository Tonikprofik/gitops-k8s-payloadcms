# AWS EKS Infrastructure

> 🚧 **Planned** — Not yet implemented.

Future addition for multi-cloud comparison. Currently focused on Hetzner for cost-effective learning.

## Why not AWS yet?

- EKS control plane costs ~€70/month minimum
- Hetzner VPS at €4/month does the job for learning
- Same GitOps patterns apply regardless of cloud provider

When I add AWS, it'll demonstrate:
- Terraform EKS module usage
- Fargate vs managed node groups
- IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)
